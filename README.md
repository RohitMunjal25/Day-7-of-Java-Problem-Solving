# Day-7-of-Java-Problem-Solving

On the Day 7 of learning Java, I explored advanced I/O concepts including byte streams, character streams, and object serialization/deserialization. This repository includes four Java programs that demonstrate:

ByteStreamToUpper.java – Reads content from a file using byte streams and writes to another file after converting all lowercase letters to uppercase.

CharacterStreamReplaceSpace.java – Utilizes character streams to read a file and replaces every space with a hyphen before writing to a new file.

EmployeeSerialization.java – Implements object serialization by defining a Serializable Employee class, creating employee objects, and writing them to employees.txt.

EmployeeDeserialization.java – Reads back the serialized employee objects from employees.txt and displays their details using deserialization.

The problems i solved are following:
1. Demonstrate a Java program with the class name ByteStreamToUpper to read a 
file using byte streams and write its content to another file after converting all 
lowercase letters to uppercase. 
2. Write a Java program with the class name CharacterStreamReplaceSpace that 
reads a text file using character streams and writes the content to another file 
after replacing every space character with a hyphen (-). 
3. Create a Java program with the class name EmployeeSerialization that 
performs the following steps: 
i. 
Define a class named Employee that implements the Serializable interface. 
ii. Include two instance variables: empId (int) and empName (String). 
iii. Create a parameterized constructor in the Employee class to initialize both 
fields. 
iv. In the main method of EmployeeSerialization, create two Employee objects 
with sample data. 
v. Serialize both objects and save them to a file named "employees.txt" using 
ObjectOutputStream. 
vi. Display a success message once the serialization is complete. 
4. Follow the above program no-03.From this “employees.txt” file access those 
attribute value use Deserialization .
